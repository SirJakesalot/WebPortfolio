        <h2>Hello!!!</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Jacob Armentrout</b> and I'm a Computer Science student at
           the University of California Irvine
        </p>
        <h3>How I fell in love with Computer Science</h3>
        <p>After high school I worked as a technician at Western Digital.
           There, I was able to get hands on experience with <i>real</i>
           hardware and work with <i>professional engineers</i>. To me, this
           was the experience of a lifetime. The best part were the people I
           worked with. I was humbled by their patience training me and sought
           to pay them back by learning as much and as quick as I could.
        </p>
        <p>One day, I finished a task early and asked the engineer I worked
           with if they could show me some "programming". He showed me a
           helloworld.java program and I still remember how my ears
           perked when the console printed "Hello World!". It sparked the
           most curious facination within myself that I never really felt
           toward any other subject. My life completely changed. It was
           like building with legos for the first time. I could snap a few
           of those colorful pieces together to make a larger piece. Then snap
           a few more together to build... literally anything my imagination
           could think of. I've been hooked every since.
