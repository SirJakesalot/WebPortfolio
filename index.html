        <h2>Hello!!!</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Jacob Armentrout</b> and I'm a Computer Science student at
           the University of California Irvine
        </p>
        <h3>How I fell in love with Computer Science</h3>
        <p>After high school I worked as a technician at Western Digital.
           There, I was able to get hands on experience with <i>real</i>
           hardware and work with <i>professional engineers</i>. To me, this
           was the experience of a lifetime. The best part were the people I
           worked with. I was humbled by their patience training me and sought
           to pay them back by learning as much and as quick as I could.
        </p>
        <p>One day, I finished a task early and asked the engineer I worked
           with if they could show me some "programming". He showed me a
           helloworld.java program and I still remember how my ears
           perked when the console printed "Hello World!". It sparked the
           most curious facination within myself that I never really felt
           toward any other subject. My life completely changed. It was
           like building with legos for the first time. I could snap a few
           of those colorful pieces together to make a larger piece. Then snap
           a few more together to build... literally anything my imagination
           could think of. I've been hooked every since.
        </p>
        <h3>My work ethic</h3>
        <p>I have had a mixture of full/part time jobs since I was 18. This was out of necessity so I can independently support myself in school (with the help of financial aid provided by UCI). Because of monetary constraints, I have consistently worked 20 hours/week during each of my 4 years at UCI as well as maintaining around 16 units worth of classes. This was not easy. I've had to make many sacrafices but I still strive to get an A in every Computer Science class I take. With so little time, the things I do spend my free time on are the things that I am the most passionate about. I work hard at school, work, and in the projects I do in my free time.</p>

        <h3>My Big Ideas!</h3>
        <p>1. The goal for this overall project is to deploy a website that can execute a sequence of jobs over a cluster of machines using Hadoop. I do not yet have all of the necessary skills to do this myself BUT I'm well on my way! I have mapped out a series of sub goals that are helping me accomplish this task.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build a small computational geometry site in Django to calculate a single job</li>
          <li>Build a FULL tutorial site in Tomcat so I can share the procedure I follow with the world and familiarize myself with Java servlets</li>
          <li>Set up Hadoop and execute the starter example (word frequency over Shakespear plays)</li>
          <li>Write a tutorial on how to set up Hadoop on <a href="c9.io">c9.io</a> from start to finish</li>
          <li>Implement a site to take a single job and distribute it across multiple systems using Hadoop</li>
          <li>Allow the site to take a series of jobs (a job queue?)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>* Will upload a diagram when I get the chance *</p>
        </br>
        <p>2. This project I am considering implementing a distributed search engine using Hadoop. This design would allow me to simultaneously add documents to index and query the index at the same time. I recently stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.mccalv.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/apache-hadoop_new_margin-nouni.pdf">article</a> that suggests using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/">Apache Lucene</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop">Hadoop</a>. I may switch to using this approach as opposed to implementing the system myself due to time constraints.</p>
